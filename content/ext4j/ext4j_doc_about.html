	<h2 class="title">Why  Ext4j ?</h2>
	
	<p class="doc_text">
		When it comes to Rich Internet Applications Sencha's<span class="emph"> Ext JS </span>is definitely one the richest and most 
		powerful library on the market. Not only does Ext JS help developers build amazing web based applications, the community
		around Ext JS is one the most active and most creative.
		<br/><br/>
		 At <a href="www.nttdata.com/europe">NTT DATA</a> we have been writing big scale J2EE applications with Ext JS 
		as the framework of choice for the UI for years now. Even though we were always able to get things done(and believe us we wrote some of the craziest Ext JS based applications), there is one thing we could'nt deny : 
		<span class="emph">As the code base grows JavaScript becomes extremely difficult to maintain and work with</span>.  
		And when the team is spread around the globe the maintainability and scalability problem becomes even bigger.
		<br/><br/>
		 This is not an attempt to diss the JavaScript language! With the browser becoming a stronger platform everyday we all know
		 that there is no doubt that JavaScript will play an even bigger role in the future. But there are facts
		 that can't by denied  and made us think about a new way of writing enterprise applications with Ext: 
		 <br/><br/>
		 - <span class="emph">Compile time errors</span>
		 <br/>
		 Being able to catch errors before the application even runs is capital for any project(specially big scale one).<br/>
		 Let's have a look at a example in JavaScript:<br/>
<textarea name="code" class="java:nocontrols" rows="15" cols="50">	
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
//code here
if(xhr.readystate == 4){
   console.log("xhr successfull");
   //Do something here
}
</textarea><br/> 
         You get the problem right ? The code above wont run as expected and no tool will catch that. Now imagine having 
         this type of errors hidden in a 10K line of code project. As the code base grows cathing this type of errors becomes more and more difficult.
		 
		 		 <br/><br/>
		 - <span class="emph">Tooling a.k.a IDE Support</span>
		 <br/>
		 JavaScript tooling has gotten better and better over the time. IDEs like Aptana and JetBrain's IntelliJ have made writing JavaScript code enjoyable.
		 Sencha just released a set of tools to make Ext JS development easier. But real software development goes beyond autocompletion and content assist.
		 Refactoring JavaScript code for example is not easy and a JS based tool will only be able to do basic  string search and replace.
		 
		 		 		 <br/><br/>
		 - <span class="emph">Real Software Engineering</span>
		 <br/>
		 Interface based design, Design patterns, Composition, Encapsulation, this are things that are not built in the JavaScript language.
		 Off course they can be emulated and Sencha came up with a nice class System for Ext JS. 
		 The problem with emulation is that there are tons of way to do the same things. While working on a big scale project it s almost 
		 impossible to ensure that everyone is following the same code style.
		 
		 
		 	 		 		 <br/><br/>
		 - <span class="emph">Backend Integration</span>
		 <br/>
		 Even though Ext JS provides some nice tools to deal with any type of backend (Ext Direct) one always has to deal with two programming models(unless she 
		 is working with NodeJS). The ability to leverage to same language through out the entire project is a huge productivity boost.

	 <h2 class="title">Meet Ext4j</h2>
	 <p class="doc_text">
	   The <span class="emph">Extj library</span> is our attempt to solve the problems mentioned above by giving developers the ability to program in <span class="emph">Java</span> and having the <span class="emph">Google Web Toolkit Compiler</span>
	   generate <span class="emph">high efficient JavaScript</span> for you. <br/><br/>
	   
	   Note that this is not about promoting the Java language or stating that Java is a better language than JavaScript. But Java was designed from
	   the ground up to support big scale applications. Plus the tons of free available powerful tools in the Java ecosystem makes it a good candidate for 
	   enterprise software.<br/><br/>
	   
	   This toolkit targets project that must use Ext JS but not necessary JavaScript as the input language. If your project is not bound the an Ext JS license(like ours)
	   and you are free to choose another library you might want to consider  <span class="emph">Sencha's GXT library</span>.<br/><br/>
	   
	    In our case our customers allready have an Ext JS license an were not willing to buy a license for a new product(Yes Ext JS and GXT require two different licenses).
	   <br/><br/>
	   
	   Now what does Ext4j has to offer ? let s look at some of the features <br/><br/>
	   
	     - <span class="emph">Free to use</span><br/>
 Ex4j is <span class="emph">free to use</span> with an <span class="emph">Apache 2 license</span>.So you dont owe NTT Data anything to use this library.
 But keep in mind that EXT JS is not free. You will need a commercial license if you 
 are building a commercial application.<br/><br/>
	   
	   - <span class="emph">100% implementation of Ext JS API</span><br/>
	   Starting with EXT JS 4.1 Ext4j aims to support all the features of Ext and add even more capabilities that native JavaScript development can not provide
	   <br/><br/>
	    - <span class="emph">Strong tooling support</span><br/>
	    This is pretty obvious. Because we leverage Java you get all the goodies of Java development and that for free!.Lets have a look a some of the features available.<br/><br/>
	    <span class="emph" style="margin-left: 5%;color:blue;">*) Code completion: Explore the methods and fields available to the object you're working on.</span><br/>
	    <br/>
	    <img  src="imgs/autocompletion.png"  style="border:2px solid black;margin-left: 15%;"/>
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	     <span class="emph" style="margin-left: 5%;color:blue;">*) Outline view: List the classes, methods, and functions in a simple tree display.</span><br/><br/>
	    <img  src="imgs/outlineview.png"  style="margin-left: 10%;width:80%;"/>
	     <br/>
	    <br/>
	     <span class="emph" style="margin-left: 5%;color:blue;">*) Debugging: Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step over, into, and out of code..</span><br/><br/>
	    <img  src="imgs/debug.png"  style="margin-left: 10%;width:80%;"/>
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    <span class="emph" style="margin-left: 5%;color:blue;">*)Static Analysis: See warnings when inconsistencies and potential problems are detected..</span><br/>
	    <br/>
	    <img  src="imgs/error.png"  style="border:2px solid black;margin-left: 15%;"/>
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    
	     - <span class="emph">Easy to learn</span><br/>
	    The API is simple and aims look familiar to all developers.<br/>
<textarea name="code" class="java:nocontrols" rows="15" cols="50">	
Button button = new Button("Ext Button");
button.setScale(ButtonScale.LARGE);
button.setXY(100, 100);
button.addClickHandler(new InteractionHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(Button button, EventObject event) {
                Window.alert("Button was clicked !");
   }
});  
</textarea><br/> 


	    - <span class="emph">Declarative User Interface (a.k.a UI Binders)</span><br/>
	    
	   Let's face Java is pretty verbose and one can end up writing a lot of code to layout the UI. That s why Ext4j introduced support for <span class="emph">GWT UI Binders</span>.
	   UI binders give the ability the layout the UI in a more declarative way. 
<textarea name="code" class="java:nocontrols" rows="15" cols="50">	
	<x:TabPanel  height="500px" width="800px" activeTab="1">
		 <x:Panel title="Chart Panel" closable="true" layout="fit">
	          <x:ToolBar>
				  <x:ToolBarFill/>
	              <x:Button text="Reload Data" ui:field="button" />
	          </x:ToolBar>
	          <x:Chart ui:field="chart"/>
	      </x:Panel>
	      <x:Panel title="DatePicker" closable="false" bodyPadding="10" layout="vbox" >
	      		<x:DatePicker/>
	      		<x:Button text="Ext Button"/>
				<x:Slider increment="5" minValue="0" maxValue="100" width="200px"/>
	      </x:Panel>
	</x:TabPanel>  
</textarea><br/> 


 Think about how you would write the same code in Java or in JavaScrit. Plus a designer will understand this code better than the 
 Java or JavaScript version of it. <br/><br/>

  - <span class="emph">Easy (JEE) backend Integration</span><br/>
 Because Ext4j leverage to Google Web Toolkit. Integrating any type of backend is a piece of cake. But if your backend is Java 
 then you will love Ext4j. GWT provides mechanisms to directly call Java methods from within you client side code. No need of Ext Direct 
 or anything like that.<br/><br/>
 
 
 - <span class="emph">A lot more ...</span><br/>
 We just scratched the surface here. Ext4j offers a lot more feature and we do have lot in the pipeline for the coming releases.
 To see what s possible with Ext4j have a look at the - <span class="emph">examples section</span>. <br/>
 By the way did you notice that this application itself is written using Extj4 :)
